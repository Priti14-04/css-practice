      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language designed to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles to HTML documents, describing how a webpage should look by prescribing colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS provides developers and designers with powerful control over the presentation of HTML elements.
